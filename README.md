<h1 align=center>twinshell</h1>

A keyboard centric shell made using Quickshell.

Meant to be used with Hyprland, but might work with other Wayland window managers.
Proper support for other WMs like Niri and MangoWM planned.

Features include:
- Top bar with typical features: 
    - date
    - time
    - battery
    - system resources
    - hyprland workspaces
    - keyboard layout
    - audio
    - network indicator
    - tray
- Screenshot tool
- Screen recording tool
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Lockscreen
- Wallpaper Client
- Notification Daemon
- OSDs for key battery levels, keyboard layout, brightness, speaker audio and microphone audio 
- App Launcher with commands (audio control, wallpaper switcher, etc)
- Dynamic config reloading
- Module system to enable and disable features easily

Planned features:
- Pinentry
- Calculator launcher module
- Wifi control launcher module
- Bluetooth launcher module
- Notifications launcher module
- Tray launcher module
- Media player launcher module
- Calendar launcher module
- Key hint for launcher modules
- Cheatsheet launcher module

Twinshell is fully functional, I've been using it for 6 months, but is not considered polished enough for public use.
